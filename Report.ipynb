    "## Abstract\n",
    "As part of the Elements of Software Construction module in Term 5, ISTD, students are expected to create a game application. However, these games were usually chunked aside after the final demonstration. Hence, the idea of having a web application that provides a platform for the students to store the games they created and make them available to the larger SUTD population and beyond, SUTD AppStore, was born. \n",
