# Angular 2
## What is Angular 2?
Angular2 is an open-source JavaScript framework for application development. Through its combination of declarative templates, dependency injections, end-to-end tooling and high-level architecture, Angular 2 makes the application-building easier.

There are already many resources covering the basics and key concepts of the framework. Here’s a [quickstart guide](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) that should get you started. There is also a curated [list of resources](http://www.angular2.com/) for learning how to Angular2.

## What language does Angular 2 use?
All your frontend template stuff is still HTML, CSS/SCSS, but your JavaScript is now *Typescript*. Basically, Typescript compiles to JavaScript and Angular 2 automatically does that when the project is compiled. Some people prefer Typescript because they think that it is syntactically easier to read and understand than JavaScript.  
> Angular2 uses Typescript which is a superset of Javascript. If you are already familiar with ES6 and Babel, it should not bother you.
