# Angular 2
## What is Angular 2?
Angular2 is an open-source JavaScript framework for application development. Through its combination of declarative templates, dependency injections, end-to-end tooling and high-level architecture, Angular 2 makes the application-building easier.

There are already many resources covering the basics and key concepts of the framework. Here’s a [quickstart guide](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) that should get you started. There is also a curated [list of resources](http://www.angular2.com/) for learning how to Angular2.

## What language does Angular 2 use?
All your frontend template stuff is still HTML, CSS/SCSS, but your JavaScript is now *Typescript*. Basically, Typescript compiles to JavaScript and Angular 2 automatically does that when the project is launched. Some people prefer Typescript because they think that it is syntactically easier to read and understand than JavaScript.  
> Angular2 uses Typescript which is a superset of Javascript. If you are already familiar with ES6 and Babel, it should not bother you.

## Comparison between Angular 2, Vue.js and React.js
Below are some of the key comparisons between the 3 popular front-end frameworks as compiled by [Majid Hajian](https://www.majidhajian.com/Angular2-Vue2-Ember-and-React-comparison/):

## Benefits of Angular 2
Since its launched last year, the popularity of Angular 2 has picked up amongst developers involved in the open source JavaScript Frameworks. Below table briefly outlines the main benefits of Angular 2, many of which are obtained from the [Angular 2 website](https://angular.io/features):

Features | Benefits
--- | ---
TypeScript Based | Angular 2 was developed on the built of TypeScript with comprehensive support of ECMAScript 6 Standardization which in-turn provide solutions on complex front end application in large projects. TypeScript is strict superset of JavaScript, open source language developed and maintained by Microsoft only. Huge surge in productivity is due to the **cleaner syntax** and **optional typing** of ES6 only. <br> <br>One of the distinct advantages over its former version, Angular 2 has its support for module landing which is complemented with using system.js specifically.
Cross Platform | Angular 2 offers more comprehensive support for cross platform solutions. Creating app like experiences with ultra modern front end capabilities with high performance, zero-step installation and offline support are main advantages of Angular 2. <br> <br>**Mobile application support** has gone top-notch ahead with strategies that combine quite well with Ionic Framework, React native and NativeScript. <br> <br>Also this version gives the developers wide-ranging support for desktop apps on Windows, Linux and Mac using similar AngularJS methods plus the ability to integrate native OS APIs.
Components based| The whole architect on which Angular 2 is built is component based allowing to easy reuse of the separate components along with **modularity**. <br> <br>Templates, Metadata, Injector, directives, injector, Services along with Event and property binding forms the building blocks of Angular 2 which are part of the hierarchy established within developed applications.
Better speed and performance | Angular 2 results have been astonishing with **higher speed** and impeccable performance in terms of browser rendering, testing, animation and accessibility across all the components. <br> <br>**Command line Interface (CLI)** in Angular 2 is exactly the right tool for building faster code generation, adding components, testing them and deploying them directly from there only. <br> <br>**Unit testing** allows for regular sorting and checking of the code in the development mode.
Route Strengthening | The **component router** allows Angular 2 apps to load quickly for delivering automatic code-splitting, enabling developers to only render the view they have requested. <br> <br>You can also access query and router parameters along with URL fragments. One can also take snapshots of the activated route for providing the data information. Nested states and sibling views are the best features of this routing mechanism.
